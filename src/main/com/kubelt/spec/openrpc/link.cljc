for a result. The presence of a link does not guarantee the caller's
ability to successfully invoke it, rather it provides a known
relationship and traversal mechanism between results and other methods.

Unlike *dynamic* links (i.e. links provided in the result payload), the
OpenRPC linking mechanism does not require link information in the
runtime result.

For computing links, and providing instructions to execute them, a
runtime expression is used for accessing values in a method and useing
them as parameters while invoking the linked method."}
