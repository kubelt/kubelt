;; System
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; For each key in the system map, if a corresponding method is
;; implemented for the ig/init-key multimethod it will be invoked in
;; order to initialize that part of the system. The return value is
;; stored as part of the system configuration map. Initialization is
;; performed recursively, making it possible to have nested subsystems.
;;
;; If methods are defined for the ig/halt-key! multimethod, they are
;; invoked in order to tear down the system in the reverse order in
;; which it was initialized.
;;
;; To begin the system:
;;   (integrant.core/init)
;; To stop the system:
;;   (integrant.core/halt!)
;;
;; Cf. https://github.com/weavejester/integrant.
