## What is Kubelt?

Kubelt is building the web3 cloud — think “next generation Cloudflare” — leveraging peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols and decentralized platforms.

Curent problems..

- [ ] Discuss the choke point in the middle with graphic
- [ ] Discuss how smart contracts are like "stored procedures" and not great for application logic
- [ ] Discuss the permaweb

Our mission at Kubelt is to disrupt and decentralize the middle-tier by providing developers with a traditional DX in a fully localized context.

## How does it work?

Kubelt works by providing a local first, full stack developer experience that includes user management, content management, cryptographic utlities and more.

With Kubelt, your application metadata is organized into a [semantic graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_semantic_graph), distrubuted over [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) and [re-materalized](#decentralized-cdn) into any application context (e.g. browsers, servers, etc) via [user centric](#user-centric) cyrptophy/wallets.

Access and permissioning to this data is goverened by an end-user cryptography and deterministacally defrenced through what we call ["Kubelt Cores"](#cores)

### Kubelt Cores

A Kubelt Core is made up of two parts. The `@scope` which represents a user, organization, or use case that governs a `namespace` or collection of content. A core will always be represented as `@<scope>/<namespace>` within this documentation.
