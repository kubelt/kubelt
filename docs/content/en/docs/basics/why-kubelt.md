FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS and better than current and new:
Things to discuss:

- Better for web2 and for web3
- bring your web2 properities to web3
- Switching cost / easty to use / dx
- resiliance, permanance, decentralized
- interoperable, composable
- centralized middle tier (includes compute too!)

### Stop paying the cloud tax\!

Existing cloud providers surprise users with **unfair fees** that scale with the success of their applications.

With Kubelt, applications and content are optionally deployed to the edge over a decentralized, local-first content routing and delivery network called IPFS, saving users from egress and other variable cloud fees.

### Users are the application

Traditional applications incentivize data aggregration that require large and expensive databases with complex governance overhead.

With Kubelt, applications are namespaced within our [Kubelt Cores]({{< relref "How-it-works" >}}) permissioned to individual user cryptography and designed to run in a fully local context -- **just like a wallet**. Access to application data, configurations and more is controlled by APIs just like with your favorite web3 wallet.

These applications that can be composed in a peer-to-peer configuration, unlocking endless possibilities.

### Content management; not content storage

The current state of decentralized storage is a high-touch experience that requires a certain level of knowledge about cryptography, networking, and more.

Kubelt abstracts this complexity away with an intuitive headless content management experience for developers and non-techinical users with existing CMS [plugins]({{< relref "plugins" >}}).

Content to Kubelt is **everything** from documents, databases, rich media, wasm compute, and more. All content remains encapsualted within a Kubelt Core and distributed over a decentralized network.

### Advantages for Web2 apps too

Connect and expand your existing application stack with an integrated edge platform to take advantage and benefit from decentralization.

Kubelt cores makes your applications wallet-aware to simplify identity protocols and enable novel, user-centric application development.

Our Javascript tools and libraries provide a familiar developer experience to make all of this easy and intuitive.

### Eventual Consistency + Consensus

Blockchain is Web3 but, Web3 is not just blockchain. The middle-tier is still centralized to provide access to bridge decentralized clients with decentralized back-ends. Smart contracts where introduced to address part of this problem but introduce new problems in speed, cost, and cascading effects (you don't want a bug in your business logic to cause a major financial loss).

Kubelt decentralizes the middle-tier, in an eventually consistent network, in the same way as your stateless web framework moved application logic outside of databases and stored procedures while also providing novel capabilities such as:

- Interoperability with tranditional and blockchain applications.
- Zero-knowledge content management
- Multi-signing mutations
- Peer-to-peer collaboration
