## What is Kubelt?

Kubelt is building the web3 cloud — think “next generation Cloudflare” — leveraging peer-to-peer (p2p) protocols and decentralized platforms.

- [ ] Discuss how smart contracts are like "stored procedures" and not great for application logic

Our mission at Kubelt is to disrupt and decentralize the middle-tier by providing developers with a traditional DX in a fully localized context.

## How does it work?

Kubelt works by providing a local first, full stack developer experience to application development that includes user management, content management, data management and more.
