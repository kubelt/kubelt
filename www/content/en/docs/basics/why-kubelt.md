_Feel free to check out **[Kubelt's approach to decentralization]({{< relref "01-hello-world" >}})** for an **in-depth** walkthrough._

## Stop paying the cloud tax\!

Existing cloud providers surprise users with **unfair fees** that scale with the success of your application.

With Kubelt applications and content are deployed to the edge over a decentralized, local-first content routing and delivery network called IPFS, saving you from egress and other surprise cloud fees.

## Users are the application

Traditional applications incentivize data aggregration and require large, expensive databases with complex governance overhead.

With Kubelt applications are namespaced within your [Kubelt Cores]({{< relref "How-it-works" >}}), permissioned to individual user cryptography, and designed to run locally -- **just like a wallet**. Access to application data, configuration, and more is controlled by APIs just like with your favorite web3 wallet.

These applications can be composed in a peer-to-peer configuration, unlocking endless possibilities.

## Content management not content storage

Implementing decentralized storage without Kubelt is hard. It requires expertise in cryptography, networking, and more.

Content to Kubelt is **everything** from documents, databases, rich media, wasm compute, and more. All content remains encapsualted within a Kubelt Core and distributed over a decentralized network.

## Advantages for Web2 apps too

Connect and expand your existing application stack with an integrated edge platform to take advantage of decentralization.

Kubelt Cores makes your applications wallet-aware to simplify identity protocols and enable novel, user-centric application development.

Our Javascript tools and libraries provide a familiar developer experience to make all of this easy and intuitive.

## Eventual Consistency + Consensus

Web3 is bigger than blockchain. Right now, the middle tier of web3 is centralized, built on web2 architectures, to bridge decentralized clients with decentralized chains. The middle tier can and should be decentralized too.

Storage and compute can happen on-chain through, for example, smart contracts. However this introduces new problems in speed, cost, and cascading effects (you don't want a bug in your business logic to cause a major financial loss).

Kubelt decentralizes the middle-tier in the same way that stateless web frameworks moved application logic outside of database stored procedures.

This model also unlocks novel capabilities such as:

- User-centric data storage
- Local-first development
- Interoperability between traditional and blockchain applications
- Zero-knowledge content management
- Multi-signing mutations for assurance and accountability
- Peer-to-peer collaboration
