Back in January [Moxie wrote about his first impressions of web3](https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html) and [Vitalik responded](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/ryk3it/my_first_impressions_of_web3/hrrz15r/). Both raised issues fundamental to the future of web3 infrastructure but also, unknowlingly provided the arguments for why and even how to address them.

In summary, Moxie argues people will never run their own servers and we tend to agree. For the majoirty of users, the convenience of centralized services far outweigh any known or otherwise unknown trade offs in data privacy.

The same convenience of centralized platforms applied to developers seems obviously true when you look at the big uptake in platforms like Infura and OpenSea. Ignoring any associated risks, Moxie himself claims **centralized platforms** permit faster innovation than **decentralized protocols** but, is this a valid comparison?

**Platforms** and **protocols** are two very different categories. The former is generally built on the latter introducing opininated technologies and services. These platforms force developers to conform applications to their opinions -- the greater the conformance the stickier the technology and risk of exploitation.

But what if you could push opinionation to the edge? How could that improve outcomes and experience for both developer and user?

As a team building a part of the decentralized future, here's our take.

### The Centralization Success Trap

A major selling point of centralization is the convenience of data aggregration and co-location of compute. When data and compute are co-located developing applications becomes very straight forward (more on that later). The more abastract the relationship between data and compute, the easier it is to create secure applications.

Platforms achieve this value through focused, hyper-opinionated services **in the middle** and, as confirmed by Moxie, this is a massive advantage for applications in early stages of development as less resources are required to get to innovate. But what's the catch?

Similar to the story of [The Walrus and the Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walrus_and_the_Carpenter) all of this sounds great _until it's not_. As your application scales with your success, the cost of these choices begin to show their fangs and you have little means of replatforming. Now you are stuck with the surprise compute and egress fees eating away at your bottom line and the pressure is on.

What you want is a system that allows developers to enjoy the benefits in the decentralized model without any of the operational overhead and contingency planning for hyperbolic growth.

### The Right Protocol for the Right Problem

If co-location of data and compute makes for a better developer experience and focused opinionated services accelerate development, how can we apply this in a decentralized platform and get similar results without the trade offs?

Blockchain seems like the obvious answer and we would agree this is true for many use cases involving **trusted state transitions**. DeFi, NFT, and other transactional use cases that require a consensus on state make great sense for blockchains! For these cases smart contracts and associated fees provide an acceptable cost in DX and UX for increased trust, security and transparency. For everything else like application logic, content, and other **eventually consistent** use cases this cost for developers and users is not acceptable.

It is, afterall, the eventually consistent use case that makes up the bulk of all applications. This is where the team at Kubelt did a lot of thinking about how to develop a **decentralized middle tier**.

### The User is the Application

Where we started thinking is, if blockchains are decentralized and clients are decentralized, could we push all the opinions out to the user at the the edge?

In doing so, we should be able to co-locate everything with the user and take advantage of a local-first application model using user cryptography and ubiquitous runtimes. When the problem is **user sized**, developers can user their favorite tools and libraries, simplifying their stack while maintaining:

âœ… Better privacy \
âœ… Better costs \
âœ… Better control

However, all of this is easier said then done! So, we decided to take a look around and see if any work in this area has been attempted in the past? What we found was an evolution ready to pop!

Starting from the early days of the Message Object Model (SmallTalk, Corba) and the more recent State Actor Model (Erlang, Akka) we finally realized, the answer we were looking for was right infront of us, **Wallets!** With crypto wallets, developers could have ubiqitous local-first access to:

ðŸ¤¯ Local-first user cryptography \
ðŸ¤¯ Messaging APIs \
ðŸ¤¯ Blockchains

All that's missing is content management for data and compute!

### Content is Everything

To truly decentralize an application you also need to decentralize the application content itself. As we already discussed, most blockchains aren't great for this, with the exception of [Filecoin](ipns://filecoin.io/). That said, you can't run a blockchain on the client which is why a **peer-to-peer content delivery network** like [IPFS](ipns://ipfs.io/) is just as important.

When backing IPFS with Filecoin all content is available through a decentralized network encoded as immutable **content addresses**. These addresses can pack anything from JSON documents to sqlite databases, WASM and more -- you pick! In doing so, you are also breaking problems down to a size that can be handled by a client at the edge where you can now **"bring your own opinions"**.

With that said, you can already take advantage of an existing **ecosystem** of open-source, client-side libraries, frameworks and tools which can continue to grow and flourish independently of any service. Take the work being done by [Ink and Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/), for example, which is solving for distributed conflict resolution data types (CRDTs).

These same content addresses can also pack and fully encrypt signatures, schemas, versions and more collapsing APIs into a fully decentralized protocol simplifying the traditional three-tier application architecture. This isn't to be underestimated as it pushes the almost the entire application to the client meaning developers can create **novel applications** and their own user experiences on a uniform, distributed API surface permissioned by the end-user.

### Permissioning = Better Outcomes for Everyone

When combining capacity, availability and distribution (IPFS + Filecoin) with _wallets_ we can now talk about a fully genearlized protocol that both convenient and useful for application developement. This is because wallets are already ubiquitous across multiple platforms and we can use them to ensure access to content and capabilities are correclty governed in way that is at par or better than centralized services.

For Kubelt, the wallet is the entry point into the network which, unlike other patforms, eliminates the need to install any new software or create new identities. Instead, we create a **"private core"** that keeps your cyrptography private but adds an always available API develoeprs can access for content, messaging and more. And that's only the beginnning of what cores can offer.

Kubelt isn't built just for Web3. A Kubelt Core is a fully genearlized backend that can breakdown data silos and simplify integrations all in a very user permissined and private way. For instance, with Kubelt, your bank can generate content addresses containing your banking information using your favorit account softwares public key permissioned by you or host and permission your health care records, and more.

It doesn't stop their either. Kubelt developers and users can provision single or multi-signing Kubelt cores that can be laid out in a configurations that gate and or commericalize access to public or protected content. These types of configurations are great for SaaS applications, DAOs, and more.

The possibilities are virtually endless.
